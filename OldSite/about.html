    About the Team</h1>
    <p>The	newly formed SailBOT team is one of many student-run engineering design teams that  showcases Virginia Tech's exceptional College of Engineering.</p>
    <p>The 2013 spring semester marked the inception of the Virginia Tech SailBot Team with the ultimate goal of designing and building a 2-meter long, fully autonomous sailboat for competition in the 2014 International Robotic Sailing Regatta held in early June. Quickly, the SailBot Team swelled to over 65 undergraduate student members from multiple engineering disciplines. Team members represent several departments within the College of Engineering including the Department of Aerospace &amp; Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Science &amp; Mechanics, and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. While mainly consisting of  students studying engineering, membership is open to any student at Virginia Tech.</p>
    <p> Designing and building a 2-meter long seaworthy craft can be complicated enough as is, and when constructing a fully autonomous boat, the technical aspect intensifies greatly. Team members will need to incorporate (and build upon) their sense of understanding in the areas of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, ship dynamics, electronics, programming, structural design, material properties, machining, and project management, just to name a few.</p>
    <p> The design team is organized in the following sub-teams:</p>
<p><strong>Hull:</strong> development of a functioning hull design<br />
  <strong>Sail</strong>: development of efficient sails (for multiple wind conditions), boom and mast<br />
  <strong>Mechanical:</strong> development of rudder and boom controls, winches, pulleys, water tight deck openings and an effective transportation method and display stand for sailboat<br />
  <strong>ECE</strong>: development of processing controls and program code<br />
  <strong>Keel &amp; Rudder</strong>: development of a hydrodynamic keel and rudder<br /></p>
<h1><span>Leadership</span></h1>
<p><strong>Commodore:</strong> Tom Shea<br />
  <strong>Executive Officer</strong>: Wes Downs<br />
  <strong>Team Captains:</strong> Andrew Barnes (Hull), Marc Rauer (Sail), George Uehling (Mechanical), Peter Vernia (ECE), Wes Downs (Keel/Rudder)<br />
  <strong>Student Engineering Council Representatives</strong>: Nick Janssens and Matthew Meyers<br />
  <strong>Treasurer</strong>: Tom Shea<br />
  <strong>SNAME Liaison Officer</strong>: Allison Oswalt</p>
